SeaGL Conference Tools

Blogging, the website is in Git
Pros: Already set up, works, looks nice
Cons: Hard for non-technical folks to add content to

Speaker Proposals, we used LimeSurvey
Pros: Web service requiring very little set-up
Cons: Information we got from it wasn't well-organized for our selection process

Speaker selection, we exported to LibreOffice Calc and then to Google Docs
Pros: some free tools, easy to access
Cons: not easy to use, Google docs has too much frame and needs a robust internet connection

Schedule building, Deb put all talks into color-coded boxes on a Google Diagram and then typed schedule back into Calc
Pros: It worked.
Cons: Retyping all chosen talks twice is labor-intensive and sort of dumb.

Schedule display, Lanyrd and conference handout
Pros: People had two options for the schedule, online and off
Cons: Lanyrd isn't part of our website (http://lanyrd.com/2014/seagl/schedule/) and isn't actually very intuitive to navigate
Alternatives (under evaluation): OSEM (https://github.com/openSUSE/osem)
Alternatives (unresearched): Zookeepr (http://zookeepr.org/), wafer (https://github.com/CTPUG/wafer)

Sign-ins, Lanyrd in advance and a gedit doc on-site
Pros: We did capture some emails to contact people for the following year
Cons: We only got names and emails, no other info.

Emailing internally, google group
Pros: It works and keeps an archive
Cons: Google

Task tracking, honor system and email threads
Pros: stuff got done
Cons: it could be easier to see who's doing what, which would make it easier to hand things off when they stagnate

Source code hosting on GitHub
Pros: works, used/known by many, easy seagl.org hosting on GitLab Pages
Cons: not FLOSS
Alternatives: GitLab
