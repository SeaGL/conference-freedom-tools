# Conference Freedom Tools

Although SeaGL is a conference all about free and open source software, by and for its 
developers and users, not all of the software that we currently use for organizing the 
conference is free. This repo is a place to share information on what features the 
conference organizers need to do their jobs, and what free and open source tools exist
as options for accomplishing those tasks.

## Help us build the list!

Please share your own knowledge and experiences with these tools! To get some information
added to the repo, either [file an issue][tracker] or propose your changes via a pull
request! 

If you're a conference organizer, tell us which tools your conference uses, and which
features they provide that are important to your workflow. 

If you know of any tools that provide any of the features that our lists say we need, 
tell us about them! A link and a summary of your experience with it are great. 

Some things to think about when describing your experience with a tool: 

* Did the tool perform reliably?
* Was the documentation helpful?
* Was the community healthy and active?
* How did it integrate with the other tools you used?
