# Conference Freedom Tools

Although SeaGL is a conference all about free and open source software, by and for its 
developers and users, not all of the software that we currently use for organizing the 
conference is free. This repo is a place to share information on what features the 
conference organizers need to do their jobs, and what free and open source tools exist
as options for accomplishing those tasks. 

Please share your own knowledge and experiences with these tools! To get some information
added to the repo, either [file an issue][tracker] or propose your changes via a pull
request!
