# Purpose

There needs to be a central location where speakers submit talk proposals and
organizers select which proposals are chosen. The selected proposals need to
be processed into a schedule. 

## Features

* Speakers can submit proposals during the CFP period
* Speakers can edit their proposals
* Organizers can use the platform to communicate privately about talk selection
* A schedule can be generated from the selected talks

## Current Solution

Until 2015, SeaGl used a giant spreadsheet and made the schedule by hand.
