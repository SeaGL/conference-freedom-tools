# Purpose

Organizers need to share information with attendees, and attendees need to 
communicate with one another, via email. 

## Features

* Users can subscribe themselves to public lists
* Organizers can moderate what gets posted to lists, if there's a spam problem
* Organizers can keep a private list, for discussing non-public logistics (?)
* Users can read the public list's archives
* Only authorized individuals can read a private list's archives (?)
* Solution must be hosted for free by someone, or hosting + volunteer time 
  must be donated to maintain and support it

## Current Solution

Until 2015, SeaGl has been using Google Groups for its mailing lists. 

## Free Solutions

### Mailman

Mailman 3 just came out, and provides all the features we need. However, it does
not have a free hosted solution, so it would need to be maintained and supported 
by a donation or volunteer. 

### Discourse

[Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) is novel and powerful FLOSS
providing mailing lists and forums. Adam [has been using
Discourse](https://forums.meteor.com/) for a few months now and highly
recommends it.

### blists

[blists](http://www.openwall.com/blists/) is a web interface to mailing list archives.
